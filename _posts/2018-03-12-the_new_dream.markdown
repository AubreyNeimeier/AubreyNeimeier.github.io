Upon graduation from the Flatiron School, I told myself and countless others that my goal is to move out west (wasn't sure where yet) and work a 9-5 in web development. It’s a pretty standard goal. But folks, the dream is changing. I am dreaming bigger. 

Do you know what a digital nomad is? They travel the world while using a wifi connection to work and earn a living. Digital nomads fall into a couple different categories of work – bloggers/influencers, freelancers, and business owners. My avenue to become a digital nomad would be through freelance web development work. For those who do not wish to start their own freelancing business, there are many platforms that host and cater to freelancers. These platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr take a percentage of every project completed as they provide the avenue to bid on projects, a database of freelancers for employers to search for the talent they want etc etc. 

This is the new dream. I want to earn a living, at least enough to survive while I travel the world on my parents health insurance. I want to travel all over, see all 7 continents and gain self-confidence by keeping this promise to myself. I promise to take big, scary leaps towards my dream of being a digital nomad for at least a year. 

As I do more research on this lifestyle, the pros and cons, and what it takes, I will update this blog post. For now, my favorite resource on this topic can be found [here](https://christhefreelancer.com/how-to-become-a-digital-nomad/). 

Cheers.
